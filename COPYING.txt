The author disclaims copyright to this source code.
In place of a legal notice, here is a blessing:

 May you do good and not evil.
 May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
 May you share freely, never taking more than you give.

                                   Stolen from SQLite :-)
Any feedback is welcome.
